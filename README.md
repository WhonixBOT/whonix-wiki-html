# Whonix Wiki in HTML format

This repo contains the Whonix wiki pages in HTML format.

The HTML was generated using a script that fetches all Whonix wiki pages from its sitemaps, then converts to HTML using [webpage2html](https://github.com/zTrix/webpage2html).


# How often is it updated?

The repo is updated on a daily basis automatically from the latest content.


# Where can I fetch the script?

The script is contained in the root of this repo as 'scrape-whonix-wiki.sh'. You will need some dependencies installed such as webpage2html (installable with Python's `pip`, `wget`, `sed`, etc).
